          <p>Passionate in Designing Digital World Solutions|Interior Designer with Experience Headed for Full-Stack Development üñ•Ô∏è | Excited to Seek Opportunities

üëã Hi there! I'm Hicham Ouartassi, and I find the journey quite inspiring that takes me from the interior design world to a job as full-stack developer. I've accumulated a decade of experience crafting beautiful and functional spaces, and have polished my skills in problem-solving, attention to detail and creativity‚Äîqualities I'm now bringing to bear on creating exceptional digital experiences.

üöÄ With insatiable curiosity driving my leap though I fervently wish to be at the forefront of innovation, I plunged into an intensive program of self-study and training in which I thoroughly learned languages like JavaScript, HTML/CSS and delved deeply into technological areas such as React, Node.js, and SQL. Both design and technology fuel me--it's this rare prism that allows me to move between aesthetics and function, creating user experiences which are both seamless efficient.</p>
